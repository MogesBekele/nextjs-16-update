// the following are some notes on design patterns in frontend development
// dont jump to framework before mastring the fundamentals of design patterns

// http caching design pattern memorization, store copy of data temporarily
// caching means storing copies of data (like files, images, or API responses) temporarily so that it can be quickly retrieved the next time it’s needed — without having to fetch or compute it again.

//content negotiation with the client
//content negotiation is a mechanism that makes it possible to serve different versions of a document (or more generally, a resource) at the same URI, so that user agents can specify which version fits their capabilities the best.

//lazy loading design pattern
//lazy loading is a design pattern commonly used in computer programming to defer initialization of an object until the point at which it is needed. It can contribute to efficiency in the program's operation if properly and appropriately used.

//bundle splitting
//bundle splitting is a technique used in web development to optimize the loading of JavaScript files by breaking them into smaller, more manageable pieces (or "bundles"). This allows for faster initial load times and improved performance, as only the necessary code is loaded when needed.


//think in systems components and relationships rathen than memorising separate concepts

//critical css
//Critical CSS is a web performance optimization technique that involves extracting and inlining the CSS required to render the above-the-fold content of a webpage. By doing so, it allows the browser to render the initial view of the page more quickly, improving perceived load times and overall user experience.

//essential state
//Essential state refers to the minimal set of data that is necessary to represent the current condition or status of an application or system. This state is crucial for the proper functioning and behavior of the application, as it determines how the application responds to user interactions and other events.
