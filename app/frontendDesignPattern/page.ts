// the following are some notes on design patterns in frontend development
// dont jump to framework before mastring the fundamentals of design patterns

// http caching design pattern memorization, store copy of data temporarily
// caching means storing copies of data (like files, images, or API responses) temporarily so that it can be quickly retrieved the next time it’s needed — without having to fetch or compute it again.

//content negotiation with the client
//content negotiation is a mechanism that makes it possible to serve different versions of a document (or more generally, a resource) at the same URI, so that user agents can specify which version fits their capabilities the best.


//lazy loading design pattern
//lazy loading is a design pattern commonly used in computer programming to defer initialization of an object until the point at which it is needed. It can contribute to efficiency in the program's operation if properly and appropriately used.


//bundle splitting
//bundle splitting is a technique used in web development to optimize the loading of JavaScript files by breaking them into smaller, more manageable pieces (or "bundles"). This allows for faster initial load times and improved performance, as only the necessary code is loaded when needed.


//think in systems components and relationships rathen than memorising separate concepts

//critical css
//Critical CSS is a web performance optimization technique that involves extracting and inlining the CSS required to render the above-the-fold content of a webpage. By doing so, it allows the browser to render the initial view of the page more quickly, improving perceived load times and overall user experience.

//essential state
//Essential state refers to the minimal set of data that is necessary to represent the current condition or status of an application or system. This state is crucial for the proper functioning and behavior of the application, as it determines how the application responds to user interactions and other events.

//reduser pattern

//The reducer pattern is a design pattern commonly used in functional programming and state management libraries (like Redux) to manage and update the state of an application in a predictable way. A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as arguments, and returns a new state based on the action type and payload.


//windowing
//Windowing is a technique used in computer science and user interface design to manage and display large sets of data or content by dividing it into smaller, more manageable sections or "windows." This approach helps improve performance and usability by only rendering and displaying the visible portion of the data at any given time, rather than loading the entire dataset all at once.

//server side rendering 
//Server-side rendering (SSR) is a web development technique where web pages are generated on the server rather than in the browser. In SSR, the server processes the request, fetches the necessary data, and compiles the HTML content before sending it to the client's browser. This approach can improve performance, SEO, and initial load times, as users receive a fully rendered page instead of waiting for JavaScript to execute on the client side.



//partial pre-rendering
//Partial pre-rendering is a web development technique where only specific parts or components of a web page are pre-rendered on the server, while other parts are rendered on the client side. This approach allows for faster initial load times and improved performance, as critical content can be delivered quickly, while less important or dynamic content can be loaded asynchronously.



//server side component tree
//A server-side component tree is a hierarchical structure of components that are rendered on the server before being sent to the client's browser. In this approach, the server generates the complete HTML markup for the component tree, which can include nested components, and sends it to the client for display. This technique can improve performance, SEO, and initial load times, as users receive a fully rendered page without relying on client-side JavaScript execution.


//micro frontends
//Micro frontends is an architectural style where a web application is composed of smaller, independent frontend applications (or "micro frontends") that can be developed, deployed, and maintained separately. Each micro frontend is responsible for a specific feature or functionality of the overall application, allowing for greater flexibility, scalability, and team autonomy in the development process.


//faster production buuilds

//Faster production builds refer to the optimization of the build process for web applications, aiming to reduce the time it takes to compile and package the application for deployment. This can be achieved through various techniques, such as code splitting, caching, parallel processing, and using efficient build tools and configurations. Faster production builds lead to improved developer productivity and quicker release cycles, allowing teams to deliver updates and new features to users more rapidly.

//simplecilty in design pattern

// idea is to keep things simple and avoid overcomplicating the design patterns used in frontend development. Simple design patterns are easier to understand, maintain, and scale, which ultimately leads to better performance and user experience. By focusing on simplicity, developers can create more efficient and effective solutions that meet the needs of users without unnecessary complexity.


//example of simple design pattern: component-based architecture
//Component-based architecture is a design pattern that involves breaking down a user interface into smaller, reusable components. Each component is responsible for a specific piece of functionality or UI element, and can be easily combined with other components to create a complete application. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability, making it easier to manage complex frontend applications.





// the truth about current job market

//most of the job are senior level enginner
//most of the job are for senior level engineers with 5+ years of experience. This is because companies are looking for experienced developers who can hit the ground running and contribute to the team immediately. Junior developers may find it challenging to secure a job in such a competitive market, but there are still opportunities available for those who are willing to put in the effort to gain experience and build their skills.

//demand for fullstack developers
// there is a high demand for fullstack developers who can work on both the frontend and backend of web applications. Companies are looking for developers who have a broad range of skills and can handle multiple aspects of the development process. Fullstack developers are often seen as more valuable to companies because they can contribute to different parts of the application and help bridge the gap between frontend and backend teams.


// ai coding
// ai coding is becoming more prevalent in the job market, with companies looking for developers who can work with AI technologies and integrate them into their applications. AI coding involves using machine learning algorithms and other AI techniques to create intelligent applications that can learn and adapt over time. Developers who have experience with AI coding may have an advantage in the job market, as this is a rapidly growing field with many opportunities for innovation and growth.

// code is still king

// despite the rise of ai coding, code is still king in the job market. Companies are looking for developers who can write clean, efficient, and maintainable code that meets the needs of their applications. While AI technologies can help automate certain aspects of coding, they cannot replace the creativity and problem-solving skills that human developers bring to the table. Therefore, developers who can write high-quality code will continue to be in demand in the job market.

//the teck stack matters

// the tech stack matters in the job market, as companies often look for developers who have experience with specific technologies and frameworks. Developers who are proficient in popular tech stacks such as React, Node.js, and Python may have an advantage in the job market, as these technologies are widely used in web development. However, it's also important for developers to be adaptable and willing to learn new technologies as the industry evolves.


//burnout is the your greatest enemy

// burnout is a significant challenge in the job market, particularly for developers who work in high-pressure environments or have demanding workloads. Burnout can lead to decreased productivity, creativity, and job satisfaction, which can ultimately impact a developer's career growth and opportunities. To avoid burnout, developers should prioritize self-care, set realistic goals, and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Employers can also play a role in preventing burnout by fostering a supportive work environment and promoting employee well-being.
